# Grid-away-grid-ahoy-

## The Mission

The design department of your company sent you a new section that needs to be added to their corporate website. It is intended to show the benefits of using their services in an easy to understand way.

On desktop, the layout should look like below. If possible, on tablets each row should contain 2 cards. On mobile all cards should be in one column.

## Instructions

Recreate the layout below using a grid in CSS.
You can find similar icons for free at https://www.flaticon.com/home (it's ok if they are not exactly the same: the layout, positioning and dimensions is what counts!)
Find a similar font on https://fonts.google.com/ (it's ok if it's not exactly the same, but try to respect font size, color, etc.)
First, try to get as close as possible without writing any CSS. Start from the general structure (a responsive grid with rectangular "cards" inside), then proceed with the inner structure of each card.
When you move with your mouse over the "learn more" button, you must have the behaviour as in the design.
Deploy on the system of your choice (GitHub Pages or Netlify)
Feeling lost?

If re-creating the layout below seems a big and confusing task right now, let's break it into two steps.

First: create this layout. It's the same structure as the final layout, but it's built using only shapes and greys. It's called a wireframe.

Once you have the structure ready, your second step will be to add the styling, as shown in the final layout below.

ðŸŽ¨ For the images and the text, use your creativity ! You can for example present your team, your passion, your projects...
Extra time?

Add a navigation sidebar to the left, with some dummy links in them
Style the navigation bar using only the framework you selected
Make it responsive and on mobile screens (< 768px) make sure the sidenav disappears completely
Bonus DUCKS EXTREME ðŸ¦†

Make a functional Hamburger menu.
